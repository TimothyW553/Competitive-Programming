# Competitive Programming

Compilation of all the programs for practice and contests

Under the contest package, you will find my Java solutions to various programming contests and practice problems. The solutions are oganized by the name of the contest

Problems sets are organized into different folders

## Note: This is only help if you are stuck. I am not doing this to boost my ego, unlike other people who upload their solutions on GITHUB
