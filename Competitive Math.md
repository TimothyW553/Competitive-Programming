## FAQ

> Will this advice get me from x to y within z time?

No guarantees.

> What if I can't do a problem?

If you're still coming up with new ideas keep thinking. Otherwise, you have several options:
 * Look at [part of] the solution. View tags [if CF].
 * Leave it for a while and do something else if you actually want to solve it on your own.
 * Get a hint from someone else.

I'm impatient, so usually I go with the second option.

## Level 0: no prior contest experience / <90 on AMC 10
 * Of course, look up AMC if you don't know what it is.
 * You should make sure that you are familiar with standard prealgebra concepts. (This may not be as easy as you think!)
 * Doing AMC 8 or MathCounts chapter contests is helpful.
 * AoPS
   * Use Alcumus extensively.
   * FTW! may be helpful for improving speed and accuracy.

   * Introduction Series
 * [This](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c3h1217349p6066794) is an excellent article pertaining to MathCounts preparation.

## Level 1: 90+ on AMC 10
 * Master all of Introduction Series / Alcumus.
 * Once you believe that you are familiar with all the material, do past tests! Note that AMC 12's before 2010 are comparable or possibly easier than current AMC 10's.
 * Create a record of your results and review as necessary.

## Level 2: 120+ on AMC 10
 * Master all the topics in the intermediate series. (Also, Alcumus is now available for Intermediate Algebra!)
 * Do past AMC 12's. Although you've probably seen most of the problems if you've practiced with the AMC 10's, it's worth knowing how to do the final five.
 * Do past AIME's. Follow the time limit, and don't look up solutions unless you are absolutely stuck.
 * Do as many (nontrivial) contests as you can (USAMTS, OMO, ZIML?, etc.)

## Level 3: USAJMO (and beyond?)

     * Recent USAMO / IMO 1, 4
     * Do a lot and hope for the best!
